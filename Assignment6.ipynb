    "# Park carefully in San Fransisco\n",
    "Car prowl is the most common type of crime reported in San Fransisco, so be mindful. Car prowlers don't take days off, but they sleep at night. \n",

    "\n",
    "# Background\n",
    "This is an exploration into San Fransisco crime, based on police reports between June 1 and August 31, 2014. After some analysis with R and Tableau, car prowl turned out to be the most interesting subject of study. \n",
    "<img src =\"SfByCategory.png\" >\n",
    "Larceny/Theft is by far the biggest category, and most of them involve a car.\n",
    "<img src =\"SfTheftByDescr.png\" >\n",
    "Other offences is quite dispersed (cutting of the long tail with frequency < 50).\n",
    "<img src =\"SfOtherByDescr.png\" > \n",
    "\n",
    "Car prowl is the biggest type of crime in Seattle, too.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aggregate analysis of crime in general didn't result into much insight. During the period of observation, various crime types seemed to correlate with each other. They took place in the same weekdays, hours of day and districts, or had too few observations to make meaningful conclusions. Also, the overall number of reports in San Fransisco and Seattle showed no drastic trends, even though the period of observation was short and covered the summer months. \n",
    "<img src =\"SfSeaTrendByDate.png\" >\n",
    "\n",
    "# Definition of car prowl\n",
    "For information, see for instance <a href=\"http://www.seattle.gov/police/prevention/auto/carprowl.htm\" >Seattle Police Department.</a> \n",
    "In San Fransisco, car prowl has been recorded under Larceny/Theft, with description Grand/Petty Theft from Locked/Unlocked Auto or Attempted Theft from Locked/Unlocked Auto.\n",
    "In Seattle, car prowl has been recorded as Theft - Carprowl.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# An increase of car prowl in summer\n",
    "Even though the aggregate number of reported crime is almost at level during summer, the number of car prowl incidents shows a significant slope. \n",
    "<img src =\"SfByDateCarProwl.png\" >.\n",
    "The number of incidents is surprisingly evenly distributed over the days of the week. Apparently, car prowlers don't take weekends off.\n",
    "<img src =\"SfByWkDayCarProwl.png\" >.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Where there's people, there's crime\n",
    "At an aggregate level, we see that reported incidents are concentrated in the central areas of San Fransisco. White collar crime like bribery, fraud and counterfeiting, and blue collar crime such as assault and robbery take place in the same areas. \n",
    "<img src =\"SfMapAll.png\" >.\n",
    "Car prowl is no exception.\n",
    "<img src =\"SfMapCar.png\" >.\n",
    "How does this match with some key demographics? The hot areas are the same as with population density.\n",
    "Perhaps surprisingly, crimes seem to take place in high income ares, rather than low income areas.\n",
